                        Everybody - One thing – I’ve not worked in a long while
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        Then again probably the same for many DD's with recent oilfield events @ 2020
                        <br/>
                        <br/>                        
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        ONE good thing is this ‘elephant’ is gone after the first job & what’s left is all the experience on my resume
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        Other thing with DD is – You’re only as good as your last job
                        
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        <br/>                        
                        <br/>
                        Operators like to have personnel with experience & my resume’s pretty long on that
                        <br/>
                        <br/>                        
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        
                                              
                        I have taken the time to get WELL PREPARED 
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        
                                               
                       
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        Essentially the DD job is just a series of steps , albeit when every last detail is covered quite a number  
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        The art I guess  is to keep it all flowing very smoothly & act swiftly at the appropriate times
                        <br/>
                        <br/>  
                        
                        <br/>                       
                        <br/>
                        (detailed records kept of all jobs done & many prep notes) 
                        <br/>                       
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        THOROUGH run - through’s  & reviews  has me covered on EVERY detail , from Thailand , Nigeria ,  Algeria & Texas 
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        Combine the preparation with the long list of rigs I’ve been on in 15 years DD (see Experience - Locations) & another 8 years previous MWD 
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        & when performing a proper review at the end of the day it’s a bit hard not to have things well engrained for the history books 
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        <br/>                       
                        <br/>
                        
                        
                        Enough preparations made that  strangely it feels more like I’m more on a crew change time off  & not so much on return from sabbatical
                        
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        <br/>                        
                        Preparations included a recent 3 month fitness program dropping 16kg & now weighing in at lightweight 60 kg 

                        <br/>
                        
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        & so  I’m ready to go
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        20Nov 2012 was my last job - as i say "returning to oilfield"
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        Outta work was my own decision I left work - work didn’t leave me - I had to take a sabbatical
                        
                        <br/>
                        <br/>                        
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        Was heading into a messy divorce in Malaysia & the kids not doing well with studies (one completely failed kid at the time)
                        <br/>
                        <br/>                        
                        Divorce completed - I got sole custody of kids & made sure they made grades
                        <br/>
                        <br/>                        
                        Now one kid finish Cardiff University & the younger at Surrey University
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
